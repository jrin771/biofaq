## Welcome to BIOFAQ 

Interactive Biology Explanations  

Also "Distill For Biotech/TechBio/Biology"

Notes to self:  
Applied and Observational/Basic Science. Applied = How do we grow crop? How do we not have person die from cancer? Basic = What is this thing? How does it work?

Bio started as medicine (how do we make sick people well?) and natural history (what is this weird leafy thing? What is that animal? etc.) 
India, Egypt, Greek were the big ones who did that 
Then middle ages it was further developed by the Islamic world 
Then europe had its classification and empiricism phase 
Microscopes -> Cell Theory  
All of this including zoology and botany and other stuff -> Evolution 
Spontaneous generation -> germ theory 
all of this goes to pea plants -> what is life question? 
Central Dogma and Cracked the genetic code it split into organismal biology and cell/molecular biology. 
Now with proteomics, single cell sequencing, etc. plus genes + environment relationships its starting to blend together more.  

Future, where are we going? 

New Model organisms (or perhaps not needing model organisms at all, or just using computers. For now though we need some kind of physical reality, so model organisms/organoids are needed before going to pure insilico simulations.) 

AI (obviously. Getting data is a big issue. There are some people who try to "learn with less data" but that's the wrong mentality. Figure out where more data is and use that.) 

Genetics/Genetic Engineering (CRISPR played a role, NGS played a role, lots of stuff here, especially partial epigenetic reprogramming which has had a TON of money starting to flow into stuff)

Cell therapies (

Protein Engineering (This mainly happened bc AlphaFold (AI!) made protein structure prediction much easier)

## Next.js Information

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
